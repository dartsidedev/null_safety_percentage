## Motivation

> A Dart program can contain some libraries that are null safe and some that arenâ€™t. These mixed-version programs execute with unsound null safety. - [Dart: Unsound null safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety/unsound-null-safety)

For smaller projects, [migrating to null safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety/migration-guide) can be done in a matter of minutes.
Unfortunately, if you are not satisfied with the automatically migrated code and you want to do the migration on your own, the migration of large code-bases can take a while.

This command-line tool lets you track your progress of your null-safety migration

It supports multiple output formats, so for example if you want to add a check in your CI/CD tool to ensure that your "null-safety coverage percentage" 

## Usage

Install the `null_safety_percentage` command-line tool either globally or as a dev dependency.

### `null_safety_percentage` command-line tool

Keep in mind that how you invoke the `null_safety_percentage` depends on how you installed it and whether you are using it from a Flutter or Dart project.

#### Global installation

If you install `null_safety_percentage` globally, you can execute it simply by typing `null_safety_percentage lib test`.

```
dart pub global activate null_safety_percentage # or: flutter pub global activate null_safety_percentage

null_safety_percentage --help
null_safety_percentage --version

null_safety_percentage lib
null_safety_percentage lib test
null_safety_percentage --output-format json lib test
null_safety_percentage --output-format=json lib test
null_safety_percentage --output-format human --verbose lib
```

#### As dev dependency

You can run Dart scripts from your dependencies using the `dart run` or `flutter run` command.

1. Add `null_safety_percentage` to your `dev_dependencies`: `dart pub add -d null_safety_percentage` or `flutter pub add -d null_safety_percentage`.
2. Run the script `dart run null_safety_percentage lib test` or `flutter run null_safety_percentage lib test`. See more example scripts above.

## Caveats

The tool is in its early phases and is written so that it runs correctly on the projects I am working on.

Currently, the way the tool decides [whether a file counts as migrated or not](https://github.com/dartsidedev/null_safety_percentage/blob/master/lib/src/is_migrated.dart) is pretty rudimentary.
I assume there must be better ways to get this information, but this approach worked well enough for me.
[Improvements, recommendations are welcome](https://github.com/dartsidedev/null_safety_percentage/discussions).

The tool is not going to work on totally unmigrated libraries. I didn't want to add safe-guards against that, so please make sure that the "input" project is at least partially migrated. 

## `example`

Don't forget the project's [`example`](https://github.com/dartsidedev/null_safety_percentage/tree/master/example) folder for a project where you can test the command-line tool.
